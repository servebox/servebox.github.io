  That's a minor release, but I hope you'll enjoy the new features, in particuliar the ability to encrypt backup files as well as credentials.

New features: encryption of backup files using GPG, improved scheduling (multiple schedules of the same job, Cron expressions), loading of multiple Sheepfiles.
